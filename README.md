The application is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this app, I have implemented localstorage that will allow you to save your activity until you press on the clear button which will delete all the activity. For CSS, I used fontawesome.css to use their icons for my app and div with class and id for javascript to access and manipulate the data.
